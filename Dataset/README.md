# Dataset

We are building our own dataset since we want to make it as close to the real life, as possible.  

So, in our work we are using our own dashcam records, then translate them into images and process them by hands to be able to put it into our model.  

For now, we have no ability to upload such amount of images onto GitHub, so we just uploaded them into Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5TJKRw4bWt2FAyXAgbo8iqNFxBqt-7o/view)  

**Pros of using custom datasets**:  
1) Represents current condition of signs in Russia, Republic of Tatarstan
2) No way we can have (without knowing) dataset, which is filtered specifically for some particular ML models.
3) Good experience, of building our own dataset, including facing all the problems, about which we might even not knowing.

**Cons of using our own dataset**:
1) Time consuming
2) Our dataset are going to be(if we approximated correctly) about of 100.000 elements, which might be smaller than some other pre-made datasets.

**TODO**:
1) Get remaining videos, which we did not receive yet.
2) Go through all the photos and produce all the important for learning information from them.
